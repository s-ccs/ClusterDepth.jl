# ### Family Wise Error of Troendle
# Here we calculate the Family Wise Error of doing `ntests` at the same time.
# That is, we want to check that Troendle indeed returns us a type-1 of 5% for a _set_ of tests.
#
# The point being, that if you do 30 tests, the chance that one is significant is not 5% but actually 
(1-(1-0.05)^30)*100 ##%

# Let's setup some simulation parameters
reps = 1000
perms = 1000
ntests = 30;

# we will use the student-t in it's 2-sided variant (abs of it)
fun = x->abs.(ClusterDepth.studentt(x));

# this function simulates data without any effect (H0), then the permutations, and finally calls troendle
function run_fun(r,perms,fun,ntests)
    rng = MersenneTwister(r)
    data = randn(rng,ntests,50)
    perm = Matrix{Float64}(undef,size(data,1),perms)
    for p = 1:perms
        perm[:,p] = ClusterDepth.sign_permute(rng,data,fun)
    end
    stat = fun(data)
    return data,stat, troendle(perm,stat)
end;
# let's test it once
data,stats_t,pvals = run_fun(1,perms,fun,ntests);
println("data:", size(data)," t-stats:",size(stats_t)," pvals:",size(pvals))


# run the above function `reps=1000`` times - we also save the uncorrected t-based pvalue
pvals_all = fill(NaN,reps,2,ntests)
@Threads.threads  for r = 1:reps
    data,stat,pvals = run_fun(r,perms,fun,ntests)

    pvals_all[r,2,:] = (1 .- cdf.(TDist(size(data,2)),abs.(stat))).*2 # * 2 becaue of twosided. Troendle takes this into account already
end;

# Let's check in how many of our simlations we have a significant p-value =<0.05 
res = any(pvals_all[:,:,:] .<= 0.05,dims=3)[:,:,1]
mean(res.>0,dims=1) |> x-> (:troendle=>x[1],:uncorrected=>x[2])

# Nice. Troendle fits perfectly and the uncorrected is pretty close to what we calculated above!

# Finally we end this with a short figure to get a better idea of how this data looks like and a histogram of the p-values
