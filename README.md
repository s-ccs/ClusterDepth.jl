Fast implementation of the ClusterDepth multiple comparison algorithm from Frossard and Renaud [Neuroimage 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118824)

This is especially interesting to EEG signals. Currently only acts on a single channel/timeseries. Multichannel as discussed in the paper is the next step.

## Quickstart
```julia
using ClusterDepth
pval_corrected = clusterdepth(erpMatrix; Ï„=2.3,nperm=5000)
```

## FWER check
We checked FWER for `troendle(...)` and `clusterdepth(...)` [(link to docs)](https://www.s-ccs.de/ClusterDepth.jl/dev/reference/type1/)

For clustedepth we used 5000 repetitions, 5000 permutations, 200 tests.
|simulation|noise|uncorrected|type|
|---|---|---|---|
|clusterdepth|white|1.0|0.0554|
|clusterdepth|red*|0.835|0.0394|
|troendle|white|XX|XX|
|troendle|red*|XX|XX|

Uncorrected should be 1 - it is very improbable, than none of the 200 tests in one repetition is not significant (we expect 5% to be).

Corrected should be 0.05 (CI-95 [0.043,0.0564])


\* red noise introduces strong correlations between individual trials, thus makes the tests correlated while following the H0.
